## Game construction

This is a tic-tac-toe game built with ruby and oop princible 
    In this game there are 3 main files 

    1- main.rb which is the file that's responsible for getting inputs from the user, outputing meesages and calling all the methods.
    2- player.rb this is a liberary that's responsable of storing players variables such as (name, token).
    3- game.rb which is responsible for the game methods, validations, comparisions and board manipulation.

    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    In this project all the logic and manipulation is put in the files inside lib folder except for these that require consistant
    outputs.

    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    the game consists of 6 steps:
    1- get players names and validate that they are unique (player1 name is different than player 2 name) and between 3-20 letters.
    2- get player1 token and validate that it's either X or O.
    3- set player2 token to the obesite value of player1's one.
    4- display the board and ask for a move.
    5- validating the given move that it's not already taken or that it's not between 1-9, this proccess runs for both players.
    6- cecking for win condition untill the first player playes 5 moves, if any player wins it displayes it, else it displays "it's a draw".
